# hola-world
my first repository boo-yah!
In '91, when I got this nick name, had a friend of a friend selling mobile phones (the ones in a bag) from his motorcycle (CB1000, if I recall correctly). had a co-worker who's boyfriend was working in Cupertino on something very secret - all she would say was 'he says 7'. Now I'm editing via a browser to a central repository of awesome code work. How's that for a changing world?
